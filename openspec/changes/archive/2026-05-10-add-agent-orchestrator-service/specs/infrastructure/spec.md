## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Agent Orchestrator Docker configuration
The Agent Orchestrator Dockerfile SHALL live alongside its source under `services/agent-orchestrator/docker/`.

#### Scenario: Agent orchestrator built from local source
- **WHEN** `docker compose build agent-orchestrator` is run
- **THEN** the Dockerfile at `services/agent-orchestrator/docker/Dockerfile` SHALL copy source from `services/agent-orchestrator/` using the repo root as build context

#### Scenario: Agent orchestrator image includes skills
- **WHEN** `docker compose build agent-orchestrator` is run
- **THEN** configured local skill roots using the shape `skills/<skill_name>` SHALL be copied into the image so runtime skill discovery can resolve bundled skills

### Requirement: Bifrost gateway configuration
The infrastructure compose configuration in `docker-compose.infra.yaml` SHALL define a Bifrost AI gateway service using image `maximhq/bifrost:v1.5.0` and configured through non-committed runtime secrets and provider environment variables.

#### Scenario: Bifrost starts with supported providers
- **WHEN** `docker compose up` is run with the required provider environment available
- **THEN** the `bifrost` service SHALL start with provider entries for GitHub Copilot, OpenRouter, Mistral, Claude, OpenAI, LM Studio, and Gemini

#### Scenario: Provider secrets remain external
- **WHEN** repository files are inspected
- **THEN** provider API keys and access tokens SHALL NOT be committed in compose files, default env files, tests, or source code

### Requirement: Orchestrator PostgreSQL configuration
The infrastructure compose configuration in `docker-compose.infra.yaml` SHALL define a dedicated PostgreSQL service for the agent-orchestrator that is not shared with DragnCards or other services.

#### Scenario: Dedicated orchestrator database starts
- **WHEN** `docker compose up` is run
- **THEN** the orchestrator PostgreSQL service SHALL start from `docker-compose.infra.yaml` and provide storage used only by the agent-orchestrator

#### Scenario: Orchestrator database is isolated
- **WHEN** compose configuration is inspected
- **THEN** the agent-orchestrator SHALL connect to the dedicated orchestrator PostgreSQL service rather than `dragncards-postgres` or any other shared database service

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Docker Compose orchestration from repo root
The full stack SHALL be startable with `docker compose build && docker compose up -d` from the repository root without any additional arguments or path changes.

#### Scenario: Root compose includes external services
- **WHEN** `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root is parsed
- **THEN** it SHALL include `external/docker/docker-compose.yml` via the `include:` directive, pulling in postgres, mc-plugin, backend, and frontend

#### Scenario: Root compose adds game-service
- **WHEN** `docker compose up` is run
- **THEN** the `game-service` service defined in the root `docker-compose.yml` SHALL start alongside the included external services and depend on `backend`

#### Scenario: Root compose adds agent orchestration services
- **WHEN** `docker compose up` is run
- **THEN** the `agent-orchestrator` service SHALL start alongside `game-service`, depend on the dedicated orchestrator PostgreSQL service and Bifrost from `docker-compose.infra.yaml`, and use its dedicated PostgreSQL for orchestration persistence and durable job state
