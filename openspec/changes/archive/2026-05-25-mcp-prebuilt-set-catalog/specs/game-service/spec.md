## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: MCP protocol compliance
The Game Service SHALL implement the Model Context Protocol, exposing game capabilities as MCP tools accessible to any MCP-compatible client.

#### Scenario: MCP client connection
- **WHEN** an MCP client connects to the Game Service
- **THEN** the server SHALL complete the MCP handshake and advertise available tools

#### Scenario: Tool discovery
- **WHEN** an MCP client requests the list of available tools
- **THEN** the server SHALL return tool definitions for game session management (`create_game`, `list_games`, `delete_game`), state observation (`get_game_state`), action execution (`execute_action`), card catalog discovery (`list_card_providers`, `search_cards_<provider>`), and prebuilt set catalog discovery (`list_prebuilt_sets`, `search_prebuilt_sets`), each with proper JSON Schema parameter descriptions

#### Scenario: Tool discovery excludes room-control operations
- **WHEN** an MCP client requests the list of available tools
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT expose room-control tools including reset, seat assignment, spectator toggles, player-count changes, replay saves, alert broadcasting, or room closure

#### Scenario: MCP error handling
- **WHEN** the Game Service encounters an error processing an MCP tool call
- **THEN** it SHALL return the error as an MCP error response with a descriptive message

#### Scenario: Setup import and export excluded from MCP
- **WHEN** an MCP client requests the list of available tools
- **THEN** the Game Service SHALL NOT expose game-state export or load-state operations through MCP discovery
